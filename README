wsilent
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wsilent (temporary name) is a fork of wpilot that aims to be a spiritual 
successor to Silent Death Online. The intent is not to create a 'better' wpilot 
in any way. wsilent is to be a completely different game that utilizes the 
basic controls, nodejs server and canvas rendering from wpilot, but to go in a 
different direction.
